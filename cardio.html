   <h1>Cardio Workouts: Boost Your Heart Rate and Your Health</h1>
   <h5>Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic activity that raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone—such as boxing drills on a punching bag. This is the zone where you burn the most fat and calories.

Some of the most common examples of cardio include walking, cycling, and swimming. However, even household chores like vacuuming and mopping qualify as cardio exercise.

Part of what sets cardio apart from other types of exercise—such as strength training—is that it relies on your body's ability to use oxygen during the workout session. A person's cardio ability or capacity can vary based on a number of factors.

Research published by the American Heart Association reports that genetics have a 20% to 40% influence over what you can do cardio-wise.1 Also, females tend to have a 25% lower cardio capacity than males and, for both genders, this capacity tends to decline with age.

This is not to say that your genes, gender, or age will prevent you from improving your cardiovascular health. But it does help to know that many factors can influence how (and how well) your body responds to cardio exercise.</h5>
